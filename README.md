# Hotwire thermocol cutter
Make hot wire thermocol cutter for sealing the lab vents for reducing air conditioner load

## Approach
We hav eNichrome wire.
Heat the wire using an electric power source

## Challenge
The resistance of the Nichrome wire of length 30 cm is about 1 ohms.
Current requirement is approximately 1 ohms.

The existing power supplies which are power electornics cut off when connected with this high load / low resistance.

## Possible solutions

1. Try with a step down transformer with no electronics.
2. Try an iron box in series with 230 volts AC, which will maintain the current in single digit ohms. **NOT SAFE** **Children not to experiemnt themselves**
